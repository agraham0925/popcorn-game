wdi-11-chi curious-turtles Project #1: Game

This game was created as my first solo project in General Assembly's WDI course.

How to Play:
	- Each round, collect as many popcorn kernels as you can in your bucket.
	- Each kernel collected in the bucket gives you 1 point.
	- Collect an unpopped kernel, lose 1-3 points (point value for unpopped kernels is random!).
	- Player with the most points at the end of 3 rounds wins.

USER STORIES:
//ADD PHOTOS HERE
	- User selects 1-2 players.
	- Hit start to begin play.

	- User gets 1 point for each popcorn kernel collected in the bucket.
	- Lose points for each unpopped kernel collected in the bucket.
		* point value is randomized between 1-3 points
	- User with most points after 3 rounds wins.

	- Rounds:
		* 3 total, 20 seconds each.
		* speed of falling kernels increases each round.

	- End Game:
		* designates which player won.
		* replay button returns to main screen to play game again.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
	- jQuery
	- Canvas

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
	- link to game once available

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
	- would like to incorporate images of actual popcorn, kernels and popcorn bucket.
	- speed of falling kernels currently not functional.
	- if user presses start multiple times in a round, popcorn/kernel speed increases.
	- need "times up alert" for one player mode.
