wdi-11-chi curious-turtles Project #1: Game

This game was created as my first solo project in General Assembly's WDI course.

How to Play:
	- Each round, collect as many popcorn kernels as you can in your bucket
	- Each kernel collected in the bucket gives you 1 point
	- Collect an unpopped kernel, lose 1-3 points (point value for unpopped kernels is random!)
	- Player with the most points at the end of 3 rounds wins!

USER STORIES:
//ADD PHOTOS HERE
	- User selects 1-2 players
	- Hit start to begin play

	- User gets 1 point for each popcorn kernel collected in the bucket
	- Lose points for each unpopped kernel collected in the bucket
		* point value is randomized between 1-3 points
	- User with most points after 3 rounds wins

	- Rounds:
		*five total, 30 seconds each
		*speed of falling kernels increases each round

	- End Game:
		*designates which player won
		*replay button returns to main screen to play game again

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
	- jQuery
	- Canvas

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
	- link to game once available

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
	- The game speeds up the animation on its own due to repeat calls of the animation function rather than written code to speed animation
	- would like to incorporate images of actual popcorn and popcorn bucket
	- DRY code???
